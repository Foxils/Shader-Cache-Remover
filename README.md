## Shader Cache Remover

This C# script is designed to remove shader cache files from common cache directories. Over time, shader caches can impact system performance. When these caches are deleted, they will be automatically rebuilt as needed.


Modern graphics card software, such as AMD Adrenalin, typically includes an option to clear the shader cache. However, this script ensures that any leftover and specific game engine shader files.

It targets files that may remain after using the driver software, as well as shader caches related to game engines, ensuring a more thorough cleanup.
